## Safari extension
Safari guys, sorry. You'll have to install this manually. Apple charges $100/yr for dev account which allows to publish on their extensions platform. The extension is free, so I'm not going to buy a dev acc.

### How install manually to safari
1. Go to Safari preferences
2. Go to advanced tab
3. Check "Show develop menu in bar
4. Close preferences and go to Develop -> Extension builder
5. Click on plus button and choice add extension
6. Browse extension in our file system
7. After click on install button
8. That's all. Too difficult, yeah?) 

You should done this every time you restart your browser. It's safari, sorry.

## If you use it
The best thanks is to put a star on github. =D
